\usage{
dbn(
  data,
  family = c("ordinal", "gaussian", "binary"),
  model = c("static", "dynamic", "lowrank", "hmm"),
  nscan = 10000,
  burn = 1000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data array or path to .RData file containing Y array.
Array should be 3-dimensional (actors x actors x time) for single relation
or 4-dimensional (actors x actors x relations x time) for multiple relations}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the data family/distribution:
\itemize{
\item "ordinal": For ordinal/ranked data (e.g., ratings 1-5). Data should be positive integers.
\item "gaussian": For continuous data. Data can be any real numbers.
\item "binary": For binary data. Data should be 0/1 or logical values.
}}

\item{model}{Character string specifying model type:
\itemize{
\item "static": Fixed sender/receiver effects across time
\item "dynamic": Time-varying sender/receiver effects
\item "lowrank": Low-rank factorization of sender effects
\item "hmm": Regime-switching model with hidden Markov states
}}

\item{nscan}{Number of iterations of the Markov chain (beyond burn-in)}

\item{burn}{Burn-in for the Markov chain}

\item{odens}{Output density for the Markov chain (save every odens-th iteration)}

\item{verbose}{Logical or numeric. If TRUE, show progress. If numeric, print detailed info every n iterations (default: TRUE)}

\item{...}{Additional model-specific parameters passed to model-specific functions}
}
\value{
A list of class "dbn" containing:
\item{B}{List of posterior samples for B matrices (static model)}
\item{A}{List of posterior samples for time-varying A matrices (dynamic model)}
\item{params}{Matrix of parameter traces (static model)}
\item{sigma2}{Vector of sigma^2 samples (dynamic model)}
\item{model}{Character string indicating which model was run}
\item{dims}{List containing data dimensions}
\item{settings}{List of model settings used}
}
\description{
Main wrapper function for Dynamic Bilinear Network (DBN) analysis. This is the primary
interface for fitting DBN models to network data. DBN models capture complex dependencies
in network data through bilinear interactions between latent sender and receiver effects.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load example data
data(example_data)

# Run static model with default settings
results <- dbn(example_data, model = "static")

# Run dynamic model with custom MCMC settings
results <- dbn(example_data,
    model = "dynamic",
    nscan = 5000, burn = 1000, odens = 10
)

# Run HMM model with 3 regimes
results <- dbn(example_data, model = "hmm", R = 3)

# Run low-rank model with rank 2
results <- dbn(example_data, model = "lowrank", r = 2)

# Run quietly without progress output
results <- dbn(example_data, model = "static", verbose = FALSE)

# Run with detailed output every 100 iterations
results <- dbn(example_data, model = "dynamic", verbose = 100)
